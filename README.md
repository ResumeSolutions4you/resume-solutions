     <h2>Resume Solutions FAQs</h2>
     <ol>
         <li><b>Why should you choose Resume Solutions?</b><br>Resume Solutions is dedicated to creating customized, professional resumes that highlight your strengths, experience, and value. With expertise in Human Resources,     Accounting, and Government Hiring practices, I understand what hiring managers are looking for and how to position you as a top candidate. Whether you’re changing careers, re-entering the workforce, or aiming for a promotion, I offer personalized attention and expert insights to help your resume stand out.</li>
         <li><b>What do employers think of Resume Solutions?</b><br>Employers consistently appreciate resumes from Resume Solutions because they are clean, professional, and aligned with industry expectations. Resumes are keyword-optimized, well-organized, and highlight measurable achievements — making it easier for hiring managers to quickly identify qualified candidates. Clients have reported an increase in callbacks, interview invitations, and job offers after using my services.</li>
        <li><b>What does it mean to be ATS-friendly?</b><br>ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System — software that employers use to scan and filter resumes before a human ever sees them. An ATS-friendly resume is formatted and written to pass these digital screenings by using proper layout, relevant keywords, and no images or fancy fonts that could cause errors. All resumes from Resume Solutions are optimized for ATS so your application gets through to the next round.</li>
        <li><b>Which resume builder template should I use?</b><br>Choosing the right template depends on your industry, level of experience, and career goals. If you’re in a creative field, a modern design might work best. For corporate, government, or technical roles, a clean and traditional format is preferred. Resume Solutions offers several professionally designed templates — and during your consultation, I’ll recommend the one that best highlights your experience and aligns with your target role.</li>
